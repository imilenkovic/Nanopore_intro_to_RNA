## Assignment 1

In ```/home/ubuntu/Share/data/bacteria/pod5``` you will find raw sequencing data done on bacterial rRNA samples (E. coli).

The run contains 12 barcodes.

bc1 and bc2 are WT strains.

bc3, bc4, bc6, and bc9 are KO strains lacking some rRNA modifications.

Find which modifications are missing in each barcode.

## Assignment 2

In ```/home/ubuntu/Share/data/yeast/pod5``` you will find raw sequencing data done on yeast rRNA samples (S. cerevisiae).

Use a modification-aware basecaller to predict pseU sites in 18S and 28S rRNA. Investigate how well the predictions match the ground truth (known modifications).

## Assignment 3

Go back to ```/home/ubuntu/Share/data/bacteria/pod5```.

Use a modification-aware basecaller to predict m5C sites. Investigate how well the predictions match the ground truth (known modifications).
